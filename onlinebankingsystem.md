Online Banking System with Flask, MS SQL Server, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap

Account Creation Form

The account creation form can be implemented using a Flask form. The form should have the following fields:

Address
First Name
Last Name
Balance
Email
Password
Phone Number
Accounts Table

The accounts table in SQL should have the following columns:

account_number (primary key)
address
first_name
last_name
balance
email
password
phone_number
Dashboard

The dashboard can be implemented using a Flask view that renders a template with the user's account information. The template should display the user's balance, recent transactions, and two options: update credentials and send money.

Send Money

The send money functionality can be implemented using a Flask view and a template. The view should take the user's account number and the amount of money they want to send as input. The view should then validate the input and make sure that the user has enough money in their account to send the desired amount. If the input is valid and the user has enough money, the view should update the accounts table to reflect the transaction. The view should then send an email to the user and the recipient of the transaction.

Update Credentials

The update credentials functionality can be implemented using a Flask view and a template. The view should take the user's account number as input. The view should then query the accounts table to get the user's current credentials. The view should then render a template with the user's current credentials. The user can then edit their credentials in the template and submit the form. If the form is valid, the view should update the accounts table to reflect the new credentials.

Admin Panel

The admin panel can be implemented using a Flask admin interface. The admin interface should allow admins to view all recent transactions, system logs, and bank account information.

Security

The following security measures should be implemented to protect the online banking system from unauthorized access and attacks:

Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for all user accounts.
Encrypt all sensitive data, such as account numbers and passwords.
Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect the system from common web attacks.
Regularly audit the system for security vulnerabilities.
Conclusion

An online banking system with Flask, MS SQL Server, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap can be implemented using the following steps:

Create a Flask project and install the required dependencies.
Create a database and create the accounts table.
Create a Flask form for the account creation form.
Create a Flask view to render the dashboard template.
Create a Flask view to implement the send money functionality.
Create a Flask view to implement the update credentials functionality.
Create a Flask admin interface to implement the admin panel.
Implement security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and attacks.
Once the system is implemented, it can be deployed to a production server.
